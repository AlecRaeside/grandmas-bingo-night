Grandmas Bingo Night
====================

So people try to quit facebook. They can't because they miss events, birthdays, Grandma's Bingo night etc. They are forced back into facebook.

So we have the problem.

The solution port events into a nice little web app that interacts external to facebook allowing facebook quitters to never miss grandmas bingo night ever again.
